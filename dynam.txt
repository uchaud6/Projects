This project, dynam.py, is a python module file that contains functions to analyze/study how mathematical functions operate
in different cycles or orbits. For example, an orbit of 1000 under the function sqrt(x) would mean taking the square root of 1000
and then taking the square root of sqrt(1000) and so forth endlessly. When these orbits of functions are being carried out, one might
find a repeating cycle of numbers that continously repeat when taking the orbit of a function. For example when taking the sqrt(1), one
will find the repeating cycle of 1. The functions in dynam.py will help to study these orbits and cycles. Function descriptions and explanations
are found in the docstrings of each respective function.
